## 1. Pencils 
> You often take notes while in school, so it is completely necesary to have a writing utensil. Out of all writing utensils, pencils (classic or mechanical) seem to be the most useful as one can easily erase if there is a mistake made. Also, (mechanical) pencils tend to last longer than pens as you simply just replace the lead. You cannot replace the ink yourself in pens. 

## 2. Loose Lined Paper
> Loose lined paper allows you to avoid having to rip papers out of your notebook if you need to. This is helpful as you can easily rip your pages while doing this, and notebooks tend to slowly come apart throughout the school year. Loose lined paper saves you the trouble of buying another notebook in the middle of the school year. 

## 3. Erasers 
> Erasers are a MUST if you are using pencils (#1)! You make mistakes while writing more often than not. While many pencils (#1) have erasers at the top, they do not last very long due to their size. Additionally, if you are using mechanical pencils, it is best to leave the eraser in better condition to replace the lead.  

## 4. Folders
> Folders allow you to keep everything organized while not taking up much space. This is unlike binders, aother popular choice for organizing papers, as binders are always at least a 1/2 inch thick. Folders serve the same function as binders as they have holes you can put papers in as well as 2 pockets.
