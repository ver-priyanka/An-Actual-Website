## 1. Pencils 
> You often take notes while in school, so it is completely necesary to have a writing utensil. Out of all writing utensils, pencils (classic or mechanical) seem to be the most useful as one can easily erase if there is a mistake made. Also, (mechanical) pencils tend to last longer than pens as you simply just replace the lead. You cannot replace the ink yourself in pens (#5).

## 2. Notebook
> Notebooks provide you with a place for all your notes to be together, so you know where all of them are. They can also provide you with loose lined paper, this can be helpful when you need to turn assignments in. Based on the quality of notebook you buy, your notebook can last you for the entire year. If you'd only like one notebook instead of multiple, a multiple subject notebook is recommended. There is a large variety of notebooks.

## 3. Erasers 
> Erasers are a MUST if you are using pencils (#1)! You make mistakes while writing more often than not. While many pencils (#1) have erasers at the top, they do not last very long due to their size. Additionally, if you are using mechanical pencils, it is best to leave the eraser in better condition to replace the lead.

## 4. Folders
> Folders allow you to keep everything organized while not taking up much space. This is unlike binders, aother popular choice for organizing papers, as binders are always at least 1/2 inch thick. Folders serve the same function as binders as they have holes you can put papers in as well as 2 pockets. Folders also tend to lst longer than binders as binder pockets tend to break quite easily.

## 5. Pens
> Although you cannot erase with pens (as mentioned in #1), pens are necessary in certain situations and classes. Based on your teachers, some may prefer for you to only write in pen and nothing else. Along with this, you are required to write in only pen for many tests. Because of this, it is necessary to have at least two good working pens. Black and blue ink are preferred, but red may be needed if you correct your peers' work in class.
